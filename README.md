# SensorPIR
A complete Z-Wave PIR sensor example using the OCCUPANCY-EXP-EVB board

This repository contains a customization of the SensorPIR sample application.
In the sample application a number of things are glossed over and left to 
the user to figure out. With this application, we take the next step and
demonstrate how to use the ZGM130S peripherals and a real PIR sensor.
In the sample application a button press is used to simulate the PIR sensor.
In this example we use a real PIR sensor and show the recommended solution
and a step-by-step example of how and what should be customized by the user
when creating your own Z-Wave product.
